# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Supervised-Techniques
A project under CSC 591(302) ADBI.

A major part of this project is the task of generating feature vectors for use in these classifiers.
You will explore two methods: (1) A more traditional NLP technique where the features are simply
“important” words and the feature vectors are simple binary vectors and (2) the Doc2Vec
technique where document vectors are learned via artificial neural networks
